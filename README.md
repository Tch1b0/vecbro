## usage

You can access the website at [vecbro.johannespour.de](https://vecbro.johannespour.de).

On the top left you'll see your current function with your support vector on the left and your direction vector. When you entered the values that you want for the function, you can just click "draw" and start entering the next function.

When you want to clear the functions that were drawn, you just need to click "clear", and the drawn functions vanish.
